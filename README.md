Face Attendance System
A facial recognition-based attendance system that allows student registration and tracks daily attendance using face recognition. This system automates the attendance process by capturing students' facial data along with other essential details and then recognizing their faces to mark attendance in daily classes.

Features
Student Registration: Register students by capturing their face and adding personal details such as name, ID, course, etc.
Face Recognition: Use real-time facial recognition to detect and recognize students when they enter the class.
Attendance Tracking: Automatically mark attendance for students based on facial recognition.
Daily Attendance Reports: Generate and store attendance records for each student.
Easy to Use: Simple and intuitive interface to register students and track daily attendance.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
dlib (for face recognition)
SQLite3 (for database storage of student details and attendance records)
numpy
face_recognition library
Pillow (for image processing)
Tkinter (optional, for GUI)
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy face_recognition Pillow
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-attendance-system.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a working webcam connected to your system for real-time facial recognition.

Usage
1. Register Student
Run the registration script to add a new student.
The system will capture the student's face and store it with their details (name, ID, etc.) in the database.
bash
Copy code
python register_student.py
The student’s face image will be stored in the system, and their details will be saved in the database for future use.

2. Take Daily Attendance
On a daily basis, run the attendance.py script, which will use the webcam to capture faces of students entering the class and mark attendance automatically based on facial recognition.
bash
Copy code
python take_attendance.py
The system will compare the detected faces with the registered faces in the database and mark attendance accordingly.

3. View Attendance Reports
The attendance will be stored in an SQLite database and can be viewed via a simple script.
bash
Copy code
python view_attendance.py
This will display the list of all students along with their attendance records.

Future Improvements
User Interface: Add a more intuitive GUI for better interaction.
Email Notifications: Send automated attendance reports via email.
Advanced Attendance Analytics: Implement features like late arrivals, missed classes, and attendance trends.
Multiple Class Support: Allow for multiple classes and different student groups.
